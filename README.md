# TCI_BasicFileWriter
Basic File Writer:  Writing stuff to a file should be easy and simple. I got tired of having to setup and write my own boilerplate code to do this each time so here we are. And here you go. Use it but don't go stealing my work tho! I'm watching you. This was a pain in the ass to write.
